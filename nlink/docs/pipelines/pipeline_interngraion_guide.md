# NexusLink Pipeline Detection and Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance on integrating the pipeline detection and optimization system with your NexusLink components. The system automatically identifies pipeline types (single-pass or multi-pass) and applies the appropriate optimizations using Okpala's state machine minimization techniques.

## Architecture

The pipeline detector system bridges the gap between different pipeline implementations (single-pass/multi-pass) and the Okpala minimizer system. It provides:

1. Automatic detection of pipeline types
2. Intelligent optimization based on pipeline characteristics
3. Metrics collection for optimization results
4. Integration with the build system

## Integration with CMake

### Adding the Pipeline Detector to Your Build

1. Include the pipeline detector in your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
# Add pipeline detector component
add_subdirectory(src/core/pipeline/detector)

# Link against the detector
target_link_libraries(your_target
    PRIVATE
        nexus_pipeline_detector
)
```

2. Set up automatic optimization in your build process:

```cmake
# Add post-build optimization step
add_custom_command(TARGET your_target POST_BUILD
    COMMAND $<TARGET_FILE:test_pipeline_detector> $<TARGET_FILE:your_target>
    COMMENT "Optimizing pipeline component automatically"
)
```

## Programmatic Usage

### Basic Detection and Optimization

```c
#include "nlink/core/pipeline/pipeline_detector.h"

// Initialize NexusLink context
NexusContext* ctx = nexus_create_context(NULL);

// Initialize pipeline detector with default configuration
nexus_pipeline_detector_initialize(ctx, NULL);

// Detect pipeline type
NexusPipelineDetectionResult* result = NULL;
NexusResult status = nexus_pipeline_detect(ctx, "path/to/component.so", &result);

if (status == NEXUS_SUCCESS) {
    // Check detected type
    printf("Detected pipeline type: %s\n", 
           nexus_pipeline_type_to_string(result->detected_type));
    
    // Apply optimization if not automatically applied
    if (!result->optimization_applied) {
        nexus_pipeline_optimize(ctx, result);
    }
    
    // Free detection result
    nexus_pipeline_detection_result_free(result);
}

// Clean up
nexus_pipeline_detector_cleanup(ctx);
nexus_destroy_context(ctx);
```

### Advanced Configuration

```c
// Configure the pipeline detector
NexusPipelineDetectorConfig config = nexus_pipeline_detector_default_config();
config.auto_optimize = true;                           // Enable automatic optimization
config.min_level = NEXUS_MINIMIZE_BASIC;               // Minimum optimization level
config.max_level = NEXUS_MINIMIZE_AGGRESSIVE;          // Maximum optimization level
config.collect_metrics = true;                         // Collect optimization metrics
config.verbose = true;                                 // Enable verbose logging
config.metrics_output_path = "optimization_metrics.log"; // Write metrics to file

// Initialize with custom configuration
nexus_pipeline_detector_initialize(ctx, &config);
```

## Optimization Levels

The system uses different optimization levels depending on the detected pipeline type:

1. **Single-Pass Pipelines**
   - Standard optimization (Hopcroft's algorithm)
   - Focuses on state reduction while preserving linear execution flow

2. **Multi-Pass Pipelines**
   - Aggressive optimization with boolean reduction
   - Takes advantage of feedback loop patterns to eliminate redundant states

3. **Hybrid Pipelines**
   - Careful optimization (Standard level with selective boolean reduction)
   - Preserves critical states while optimizing where possible

## Build System Integration

### Automatic Detection During Build

For CMake-based projects, you can add an automatic detection and optimization step by including the following in your top-level CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
# Find all pipeline component targets
get_all_targets(pipeline_targets)

# Add optimization step for each component
foreach(target ${pipeline_targets})
    add_custom_command(TARGET ${target} POST_BUILD
        COMMAND test_pipeline_detector $<TARGET_FILE:${target}>
        COMMENT "Detecting and optimizing pipeline: ${target}"
    )
endforeach()
```

### Integration with Continuous Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, use the following pattern in your build scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Build project
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Optimize all components
for component in $(find . -name "*.so" -o -name "*.dll"); do
    ./test_pipeline_detector "$component" "metrics.log"
done
```

## Performance Considerations

- Pipeline detection typically adds minimal overhead (1-5ms per component)
- Optimization is more intensive and can take 10-100ms depending on component complexity
- For large projects, consider enabling optimization only in Release builds
- Memory usage is proportional to the state machine size (typically <10MB)

## Best Practices

1. **Component Design**
   - Design pipelines with clear input/output formats
   - Document pipeline types in your component's metadata
   - Use consistent patterns for similar pipeline types

2. **Optimization Configuration**
   - Start with conservative optimization levels (BASIC)
   - Increase to more aggressive levels after testing
   - Always validate component functionality after optimization

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Enable metrics collection to track optimization benefits
   - Monitor metrics over time to identify optimization opportunities
   - Set up automated reporting of optimization gains

4. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive test suites for optimized components
   - Verify that optimization preserves functional correctness
   - Include edge cases that might be affected by state reduction

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Detection Failures**
   - Check if component file exists and is accessible
   - Verify component format (must be a valid shared object)
   - Check file permissions and ownership

2. **Optimization Failures**
   - Try lower optimization levels
   - Check for memory constraints
   - Look for special state patterns that might complicate optimization

3. **Build Integration Problems**
   - Verify paths to components are correct
   - Ensure detector is properly linked
   - Check for any dependency issues

By automatically detecting pipeline types and applying appropriate optimizations, you can significantly reduce component size and improve runtime performance with minimal effort.
